## Getting Started: Microcontroller
1. set up [CloudMQTT](https://www.cloudmqtt.com/) account and build a MQTT broker
2. set up WiFi environment
3. set up the HTTP server to send POST requests to
4. create a header file in `ESP8266` folder
5. include all the credentials in the header file
(Don't forget to include the file in `.gitignore`)
